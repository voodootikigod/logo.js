# A JavaScript Badge

A badge for JS that matches the style of the HTML5 and CSS3 logos.

<img src="badge_js-strict.png" width="200" />

<img src="badges_html5_css3_js-strict.png" width="400" />

Since 3 (ES5 in ES3 mode) and 5 (ES5 in regular strict mode)
are already used on the CSS and HTML shields,
S (for strict mode) is used for the sake of distinctness.
